            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">India is a nation with a population of around 139.34 crores and still,
                India’s GDP is around 6.95% today which was just 2% at the time when we got independence from Great
                Britain. We have grown but at a very stable rate what shall be the reason behind it? Is it the young
                generation, the government, the fear of not taking the risk, or the lack of entrepreneurship skills? The
                major reason which shall be taken into the account today is the education system of our country it is
                indeed great but there are some steps which can be taken to step up this journey of growing in our
                country.
                the very start after the-independence phase, the Indian education system has evolved a lot. At the
                time of getting independence from the British which was around 75 years ago the literacy rate was only
                12% which has grown significantly today and become 74%. Even after having a literacy rate of 74% what
                can be the reason today that more than 80% of our literate students are unemployed or are in the search
                of a better job, and more than 70% of engineering students do another job after graduation rather than
                the fieldwork, Even after having a country that is filled with rich mineral resources, employment
                opportunities, and the world’s 3rd largest democracy why our growth is taking too much time? why our GDP
                is growing at a very stable rate and currently is only 6.95%? Has the education system in our country
                not good enough to make us grow our country or it is just us? </p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">How Can We Improve Education System</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">These few are the reasons and solutions for the same how we can make
                improvements in our education system;
                1) from the very first start of school and in their upbringings, children are taught to have status in
                society which makes them fear failure and they do not even try to follow their passion and this can be
                the major reason that after completing12th standard which is hsc in India 70% of people go into the
                field of commerce/BBA but very few of them start their business majority of them gone on to do the 9-5
                job hence it creates a shortage in employment and creates unemployment.
                2) the success rate of doctor doing MBBS degree is 89% which makes majority of MBBS graduate student a
                successful person in their field whereas the success rate of an MBA graduate or BBA graduate starting
                their own business is just 10% which makes 90% of start-ups fail. Both degrees are being studied in and
                through Indian education system only but the major reason or the difference behind this is that the
                professor who taught MBBS students are actually doctors who have experience of quite a few years in
                their respective businesses and they also have hospital just beside university in order to practice what
                their profession while the professors who taught BBA and MBA students are actually the professors
                holding Ph.D.

    <section class="section">
        <div class="paras">
            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Let's grow together</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Children in our education system are taught about different
                individual things like the birthdate of great people the dates of different battles and the date of the
                death of kings and various other things while culture is important to expect of human life to learn but
                a majority of these things does not come handy when they decide to go into the real world to earn money
                they are required to have practical experience with skills so the actual things which children should be
                taught from the very start are the actual skills, discipline, and cultural value so children should also
                have one mandatory period for entrepreneurship skills, digital and social change so that they can learn
                how to make money effectively while following one passion.
                4) doing a job business or any sort of thing requires practice in one has to become the best at what
                they do as they say practice makes a man perfect so why aren’t we have a period where students are asked
                to learn and practice the skills like communication skills, Microsoft excel, PowerPoint presentation
                skills. India has an education system that is very much devoted to theoretical knowledge while the most
                important thing which children shall be taught is practical knowledge, we should put more emphasis on
                having children learn practical knowledge from school.</p>
